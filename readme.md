# A Scalable Web App in Google Cloud with StencilJS, TypeScript, Docker, Kubernetes, TDD, HarperDB

## Overview

This repository contains a scalable web application built using cutting-edge technologies and best practices. The application is designed to run on Google Cloud, leveraging StencilJS for component-based UI, TypeScript for robust type checking, Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, and HarperDB as a backend database. The development process emphasizes Test-Driven Development (TDD) to ensure high code quality and reliability.

## Features

- **StencilJS**: Modern web components for reusable UI components.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly-typed programming language for enhanced code quality and maintainability.
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent development and production environments.
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration for scalable and resilient application deployment.
- **TDD (Test-Driven Development)**: Methodology ensuring high-quality code through rigorous testing.
- **HarperDB**: NoSQL database for flexible and scalable data management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14.x or later)
- **Docker** (v20.x or later)
- **Kubernetes CLI** (`kubectl`)
- **Google Cloud SDK**

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the Project**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Docker Setup**

   Build and run the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker build -t your-app-name .
   docker run -p 8080:8080 your-app-name
   ```

5. **Kubernetes Deployment**

   Create the Kubernetes deployment and service:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/service.yaml
   ```

6. **Access the Application**

   Once the deployment is complete, you can access the application through the assigned IP or domain.

## Testing

Run tests using the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

## Deployment

For deployment to Google Cloud, follow these steps:

1. **Build and Push Docker Image**

   ```bash
   docker tag your-app-name gcr.io/your-project-id/your-app-name
   docker push gcr.io/your-project-id/your-app-name
   ```

2. **Deploy to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deployment-gke.yaml
   ```
